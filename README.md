# SQL-Challenge
In this assignment I was tasked with Modeling, Engineering, and Analyzing a set of data. This script designs the tables to hold the data from the CSVs, imports the SCVs into an SQL database, and then answeres some questions about the data.

## Data Modeling:
To model the data I inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables.

## Data Engineering:
- Used information given to create a table scheme for each of the six CSV files. Specifies data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
- Imported each CSV file into corresponding SQL table

## Data Analysis:
After completing the database, the following was done:
    1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex and salary
    2. List employees who were hired in 1986
    3. List the manager of each department with the following info: department number, department name, manager's employee number, last name, first name
    4. List the department of each employee with the following info: employee number, last name, first name, and department name
    5. List all employees whose first name is 'Hercules' and last name begins with 'B'.
    6. List all employees in the sales department, including their employee number, first name, last name, and department name
    7. List all employees in the sales and development department, including their employee number, first name, last name, and department name
    8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names.
